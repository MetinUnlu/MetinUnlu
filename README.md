# Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hello, I'm Metin, a Data Scientist with a solid foundation in engineering and a keen interest in extracting meaningful insights from data. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Verona, Italy. My journey in the world of data is underpinned by a robust background in Mechanical Engineering from Cukurova University, where I also delved into Robotics.

## My Professional Landscape

- **Diverse Experience:** My professional experiences, including my role as a Digital Transformation Analyst at SASA and a stint as a Project Engineer, have equipped me with a unique perspective on how data drives decision-making across different sectors. 

- **Technical Proficiency:** I am adept in Python and its essential libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Sci-Kit Learn), SQL, and machine learning techniques, complemented by skills in data visualization (Power BI) and mechanical engineering tools like SOLIDWORKS and AutoCAD for a well-rounded skillset.
